## Want to try Cerebro?
Cerebro is not an official Chrome extension _(not yet anyway)_
However, you are free to try it out by downloading this repo and
loading it into chrome by following [these instructions](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/get-started/tutorial/hello-world#load-unpacked).

Enjoy!
